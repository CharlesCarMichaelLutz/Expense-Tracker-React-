## Summary

The Expense Tracker in React was a little difficult getting off the ground. However once I was able to grasp some of the main concepts I was able to gather momentum and charge forward with the application. Building the three different connected components was cool to see in action. Figuring out what props to send into the Form component from the App class became much more clear as I thought about it deeply. The most challenging part was adding and maintaining State in the Expense Tracker. Once I got the State working properly from the top of the App component, then the flow and execution came to fruition. I had  a blast working in the React library and building this application.
